Title: Game Development & Process Log

Phase 1: Concept
Inspired by classic LED ping-pong reflex games
Designed for both learning and entertainment

Phase 2: Prototyping
Built LED movement logic on ESP8266
Tested bounce logic with delays and GPIO
Validated wiring with 1kÎ© resistors

Phase 3: Python Integration
Serial connection using pyserial
Created tkinter-based UI with START/STOP/RESET
Added scoreboard logic and game states

Phase 4: Testing
Calibrated LED speeds and UI delays
Handled edge cases like bounce direction reversal
Added serial error decoding for robust communication

Phase 5: Finalization
Cleaned UI for GitHub publishing
Documented everything with circuit diagram, code comments, and requirements
